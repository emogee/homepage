# AI R&D, Ontology, Psychology, Neurology

I work at the intersection of minds, brains and machines. My AI work has involved common sense reasoning, knowledge graphs, chat bot/dialog systems/assistants and neuropsychiatric assessment.

I do AI R&D.  My background combines ontology (or knowledge engineering), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), cognitive science, clinical psychology and neurology.  I have done work building next generation Alexa-like personal assistants, done independent research on neuropsychiatric assessment based on patient speech, common sense reasoning and virtual reality platforms for studying autism and ADHD.  I live in San Francisco.
